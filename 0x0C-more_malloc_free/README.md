This project aims to cover malloc, free.
The function free() is used to deallocate the allocated memory by malloc(). It does not change the value of the pointer which means it stil points to the same memory location.
The following tasks were done:
0.Write a function that allocates memory using malloc.
1.Write a function that concatenates two strings.
2.Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.
3.Write a function that creates an array of integers.
