Variadic functions are functions in programming languages that can accept a variable number of arguments. In C, the most common use case for variadic functions is to create functions that can take a variable number of arguments of different types. The most well-known example of a variadic function in C is printf.
The syntax for defining a variadic function in C involves using the ellipsis ('...') as the last parameter in the function's parameter list.
